# GoIntern Web and Android App
A Web + Android application platform that helps students look for internship ooportunities. The platform was designed and developed back in 2014 as a personal practivce project. It has not been maintained and was added here just for the purpose of looking back at some older personal projects. I **do not** recommend that anyone refer to this code.
